# Realtime Market Data

This project is a pretty ghetto solution for monitoring the performance of a portfolio in realtime.

It uses Selenium to open a Chrome browser and fetch the price from the Yahoo! Finance page for a certain ticker.

It's still work in progress, but it would be nice to be able to track multiple tickers simultaneously.

In order to work, it requires a chromedriver compatible with the version of your Chrome installation.
